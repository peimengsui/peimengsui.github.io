This is Peimeng Sui. I'm originally from China, and came to the US for undergrad study at UCLA. I'm now living in the US with my lovely wife and our cat. We also spent two years in Switzerland. I work as a machine learning engineer, passionate about AI applications for positive impact in recommendation systems, search relevance, advertisement, and AR/VR.

**Document Anything** is a space where I want to share various topics, including but not limited to technical learnings, skill shares, music/book/movie reflections, travel highlights, sports, etc.
