## Paper Share: `LOGIN: A Large Language Model Consulted Graph Neural Network Training Framework`
I start to read papers being published at [WSDM 2025](https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2025/accepted-papers/). Specifically, I am interested in those applying advanced large foundation models in domains such as recommendations and search. 
This share is about a LLM application in Graph Neural Network (GNN) training.
