## Resources to Learn Diffusion Models: From Theory to Practice
Diffusion models are everywhere today, powering many of the most exciting image and video generation systems. There are plenty of papers, blog posts, and codebases available, but getting started isn’t always straightforward. Personally, I found that reading academic diffusion papers early on can be intimidating without a strong foundation in the underlying math.

Beyond theory, there is also the challenge of turning conceptual understanding into working code and concrete applications. In this post, I share a curated set of learning resources and practical tips based on my own learning path, which helped me build intuition from first principles and eventually complete a small, hands-on project.

### Theory and Mathematical Foundations

When I first started learning about diffusion models, I went straight to the foundational academic papers. I quickly found myself getting lost in the details and struggling to identify the common ideas shared across different formulations. Stepping back, I realized that I needed resources operating at a higher level of abstraction—ones that frame diffusion models within the broader context of generative modeling and machine learning.
Below are several resources that I found especially helpful for building a solid mathematical foundation for diffusion models.

#### MIT Course 6.S184: Introduction to Flow Matching and Diffusion Models

I especially like the multi-modality of this course.
